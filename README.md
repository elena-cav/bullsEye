Challenge 9 - “Bullseye”

The challenge this week is to generate a square dartboard of side length n. The numerical values on the board should increase with proximity to the centre of the board. For boards of an even number size, the centre will be made up of the four highest values.
Rewards:
:four: Points are awarded for generating a dartboard of any given size (where n > 0).
:three: Further points are awarded for using only 1 loop.
:three: Further points are awarded for generating circular\* dartboards.

- You should print spaces to represent the area outside of the board.
  Example:
  For a square dartboard of size 8, the expected output would look something like:
  11111111
  12222221
  12333321
  12344321
  12344321
  12333321
  12222221
  11111111
